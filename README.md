# Reinforcement Learning in a Flappy Monkey (?) Python Game
![Positional Setup of the Monkey and State of Game](reference_monkey.png)

This is a brief introductory project, completed in partial fulfillment of CS181 at Harvard College, on Q-Learning via
[the Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/epsilon-greedy-algorithm-in-reinforcement-learning/).
Credit for the visual/audio assets go to CS181 Spring 2023. A video of the learning process (visualized) is in the works.

Arguably, Epsilon-Greedy is perhaps suboptimal for this task, but it is meant as an introductory project to 
reinforcment learning and the agent's choice between exploration and exploitation.
